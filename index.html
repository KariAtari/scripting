        <h1>ABOUT </h1>
        <p>Kari McKay is a full-time student in Lethbridge College’s Multimedia Production program focused on further developing her graphic design and programing abilities. Having grown up with an interest in art-related media, she has always been drawn to digital art and writing for her original stories. She has also taken a few commissions for character design as well as finished pieces for family and friends. Just like many creatives, Kari is also interested in animation and films, having spent a lot of time watching and taking inspiration from many genres. Her favourite film is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12593682/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank"><b>Bullet Train</b></a>, an action comedy film that perfectly ties every plot element together. The nostalgic memories of her childhood further inspire her to make stories that can connect with people.</p>

        <p>Before moving to Lethbridge, Kari grew up in Medicine Hat and graduated from Crescent Heights High School. She was consistently on the honour role, and she loved participating in the Alberta Skills Competition for 2D Animation for two separate years with support from her teacher, Donna Armstrong. She received awards for Multimedia/Digital Arts and Media and for working on the school yearbook. As a part of the committee, she took pictures of school events and designed the front covers. Kari loves all the forms stories can be told in and aspires to do exactly that with whatever future career she earns.

        <p> Above are samples of my more cartoony work. I don’t limit myself to drawing only in one style as I believe experimenting is the best way to improve your creativity and skills. However, the more graphic and solid colour style is a lot more flexible with its uses compared to full illustrations. I love both equally, especially when I get to work with fun and bright colours. Characters are my speciality and drawing and creating designs is something I am almost always doing in some form. </p>

        <p>For this style specifically, my greatest inspiration comes from late 2000s cartoons that are very shape-focused such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318233/ " target="_blank"><b>My Life as a Teenage Robot.</b></a> Everything is built out of simple shapes but it is very charming and pleasant to look at. Another key inspiration are low-poly video games that have very limited shading that they almost look 2D. <a href="https://katamari.fandom.com/wiki/Katamari_Damacy" target="_blank"><b>Katamari Damacy</b></a> has such a unique look and aesthetic that is hard to find in new releases. That lineless look has inspired many of my art pieces and the game itself is one of my favourites. </p>
